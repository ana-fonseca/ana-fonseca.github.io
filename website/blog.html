		<h3>Students: How can you enter the Job Arena?</h3>
		<p>December 15, 2014</p>
		 
		<p>During the winter holiday season, many people think of family engagements, presents, or how NOT to be that memorable employee in the company's holiday party. But for many students, December marks the time to reflect on previous accomplishments, grades, and say: How can I get a job?</p>
		 
		<p>Unfortunately, unless you are well connected, the corporate ladder is your next pit stop after graduation. But how can you improve your odds when many students are competing against you?</p>

		<p>Well, you can start by establishing your brand in the social landscape. Here are some tips you should consider as you enter or grow in your professional field:</p>

		<h4>1. Be a LinkedIn All-Star:</h4>
		 
		<p>Invest in your brand by setting a comprehensive view of your education, employment history, and organization affiliations in LinkedIn. Your page will attract peers, recruiters, and professionals looking for someone with your qualifications and personality. Recruiters will always look for your online, personal stamp after they review your resume.</p>

		<p>If you are a student with a small job history, join organizations in your industry, participate in forums, and feature classes under your education.Tailor your profile headline and be creative, but always keep in mind LinkedIn is not Facebook. If you are an active participant in class, add your professor to grow your professional circle.</p> 

		<h4>2. Stay in the loop, Tweet</h4>
		 
		<p>This was something even I struggled in the beginning. Twitter is an incredible resource because you can read what industry experts have to say about current events within minutes. It also allows you to reach them with a tweet or a mention, so why not take advantage of that? Twitter is the megaphone of your LinkedIn profile, so make sure you link your LinkedIn to your Twitter account and vice versa.</p>

		<h4>3. Be Social for Pete's Sake</h4>

		<p>I make this tip a bit general because everyone has different comfort zones. If public speaking is your forte: make a blog, participate in conferences, join happy hours hosted by organizations you follow.</p>

		<p>If you are more private, befriend your classmates and expand your circle over time. Your classmates might be your future colleagues or supervisors, so remember to be kind, reasonable, and patient to everyone. It's better to be remembered as an optimistic or neutral classmate than the nasty person who refused to compromise in a group presentation.</p>

		<p>Upward mobility is greatly influenced by social interactions. Control the conversation, remain engaged, and remain positive as you seek your dream job!</p>
